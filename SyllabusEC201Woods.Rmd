# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

 > A study of the choices individuals face as participants in the markets for goods, services and factors of production like labor; behavior of profit-maximizing firms operating in markets with varying degrees of competitive pressure; potential role of government in intervening to influence market outcomes using taxes and subsidies; reasons for international trade and economic inequality.

It is my intent to give you a basket of tools that you can use to better understand the news, your later economics courses, and how small differences in institutions can dramatically change the choices we make.

# Proficiency-Based Course

Given the uncertainties about how courses are going to be delivered and uncertainties about student and faculty health, I have made some changes to the structure of the class that will allow for more time flexibility.

Your grade in the class will be determined by the number of modules you complete at an acceptable level.  The more modules you complete, the higher your grade.

The homework assignments and quizzes for each module will be available for three weeks, but will be different in each of those three weeks.  If you don't acceptably complete a homework assignment and a quiz, you can not complete that module.


Each module will include:

+ A series of readings and videos for you to review.  The readings will be from the textbook and the videos will be a combination of videos that I have created and external videos.  This is intended to replace the one-to-many, sage-on-stage lectures, where there is little student interaction. 

    + If you attend the Monday course meeting, please read the text and watch the videos before class.
    + The Monday meeting will be devoted to the current module(s).

+ After you review the material you will complete a written homework assignment. If that assignment is acceptable -- you may take the quiz on that module. 

    + Homework assignments will generally be available by the Wednesday before the Monday they are due but may be up earlier.
    + You may take as much time as you like on homework assignments.
    + The **homework assignments will be due Monday at 11:59 pm**.  This allows us to grade the assignment before the regularly scheduled quiz time on Wednesday.
    + If your homework is not of acceptable quality, you will be able to complete another assignment the next week and if that is acceptable, you may take the quiz then.
    + Acceptable performance is not point based but will be identical for all students.
    + Feedback on your answers will be given in D2L and will constitute the key.

+ Each module quiz will be available during the the Wednesday course period only. If your module quiz score is above a certain level -- you have completed the module (with one exception).

    + These quizzes are timed and intended to take 20 to 30 minutes but will stop you from continuing after 60 minutes.
    + They will, most commonly, consist of 35 multiple choice questions shown to you two at a time in a way that does not allow you to go backwards.
    + **Module quizzes must be completed by 1pm Wednesday**.
    + The acceptable score will vary by quiz, but will be the same for all students.
    + If your quiz score is unacceptable, you will be able to take a similar quiz the next week.  *There is no need to complete a another homework assignment in this module.*
    + If you pass the quiz on the last date it is available, you must meet with the instructor for a one-on-one meeting where you will be asked to explain in detail some of your quiz and homework answers.  If your explainations are acceptable, you will recived credit for passing the module.  If not, there will be no more opportunities to pass the module.
    + The One-on-one meetings must be _completed_, not scheduled, within two weeks of the quiz. You can schedule through https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/.  It is your responsibility to schedule this meeting.


The regularly scheduled course time will be interactive and problem solving, focusing on getting you to use and understand the course material on a less superficial level. The Monday meeting will be devoted to the new module and the Wednesday meeting will be a mix of the new module and the last two modules.

## How This Provides Flexibility

If you don't pass the module's homework and quiz the week the topic is introduced, you can take it the next week but there will also be new modules, or module, with their own homework assignments and quizzes to complete.  In fact, if you don't pass it twice, you can still redo the work in the third week.

This means that if your homework and quiz performance is acceptable, for each module you will turn in one homework on Monday and take a 30 minute quiz on Wednesday during, or soon after, the class meeting and that is it.  If you get a week or two behind, you need to double or triple the your workload and will have to complete three quizzes during the Wednesday meeting.

Passing the quiz at the last possible attempt brings an extra cost, you have not passed the quiz and don't get credit for the module until you meet one-on-one with me to discuss your answers. You need to make the case that you understand the material or the quiz does not count.

You must must schedule the one-on-one meeting within two weeks of the quiz or you will not receive credit for the module. You will receive an email notification after you pass the quiz but no other reminders.  Scheduling this appointment is the students' responsibility.

## Use of Final Exam Period

Since new modules will be introduced in the last two weeks, it will not be possible to follow the three-week cycle established above.  The final exam period will be used to compress two weeks of quizzes and homework into one.

There will be  homework assignment available for each of the last three modules due that Friday at 11:59 PM.  If you have not completed these modules, i.e., passed the homework and quiz, you can complete these homework assignments. 

If you complete and pass any of those homework assignments, you will be allowed to take the associated twenty to thirty minute quiz during the final exam period. Please note that you may be taking more than one quiz during that period.

## What Ifs

+ Q: What if I pass the homework but can't pass the quiz after three attempts?  A: Then you didn't pass the module.  There is no partial module credit for turning an acceptable homework assignment.
+ Q: I passed the quiz on the third attempt but did not schedule a one-on-one meeting to discuss answers.  What happens? A: Again, this you did not pass the module. It is your responsibility to schedule the meeting. That meeting should be scheduled through https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/.
+ Q: What if I get sick? A: It depends on how severe it is.  If it is something mild, less than two weeks, you can catch up on the material in the third week.  If it is severe, longer than two weeks, you can make a deadline appeal https://www.pdx.edu/registration/DAC.  You must send documentation, but it removes the course from your transcript and gets you your money back.

## Contact Information

Communication will be handled through slack http://fall20ec201.slack.com/. You should have received an invitation, if not, just go to that URL and use this link (https://join.slack.com/t/pdx-jwk2529/shared_invite/zt-hjweabht-PCxpqeCw_fRgtNAJqNXQXg) and your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started (https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users)

Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication.  It even handles phone and video calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels, e.g., #general. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message, i.e., @woodsj.  


Office Hours:

+ There are no in-person office hours this term.  We will use Zoom to meet face to face. 
+ Drop in office hours are Monday 3-4pm and Tuesday 10am-Noon through the last week of class. I will keep a Zoom meeting up during this time.
+ You can schedule one-on-one meetings at https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/.


# Textbook and Other Resources

I have assigned Krugman, Paul R., and Robin Wells. Microeconomics ed. 5., Worth Publishers, 2018.(ISBN-10: 1-319-09878-9).  This textbook is amazingly overpriced, but the price will fall as the 6th edition has been issued.  I will not be assigning questions from the chapters, so feel free to purchase one of the earlier editions of the book.

The earlier editions can be found at a more reasonable price and can even be rented for less than \$20. Just remember that you are responsible for keeping track of the differences in chapter numbering and the differences between editions. You can find the table of contents for the 5th edition here (https://www.macmillanlearning.com/college/us/product/Microeconomics/p/1319098789?selected_tab=Contents).

## Learning Managment System

Just about everything you need will be in D2L.  The readings and videos for each module are in the contents section.  The homework assignments, the things you do in a separate document and upload, can be found under Activities:Assignments, or on the calendar you see on the front page.  The quizzes, which are timed things that you do directly in d2l, are fund under Activities:Quizzes as well as the calendar.

If there is a homework or quiz that you think you should be able to take but can't, message, i.e., @woodsj, me on slack and I will look into it.  If it is a problem, its a problem for everyone and needs to be fixed quickly.  Please don't message me about quizzes being unavailable if you have not checked your homework grade and verified that your homework is acceptable and you passed.

There are some useful links, e.g., the syllabus, on the landing page.  The rest is kept as simple and 'stock' as possible.

# Assessments and Grade Policy

Your grade in the class is determined by the number of modules you acceptably complete. Each module roughly corresponds to a chapter and there are a total of 14 modules.

To acceptably complete a module you must turn in an acceptable homework assignment and complete a quiz at an acceptable level.  Furthermore, if you pass the quiz on the last possible date, you must meet one-on-one with me to discuss your answers and give acceptable responses.

Here are the required number of successfully completed modules required for each grade:

+ A: 12 Modules 
+ B: 10 Modules
+ C: 8 Modules
+ P: 8 Modules
+ D: 6 Modules


## P/NP Grades 

PSU's policy on how P/NP grades will be used during the COVID-19 pandemic is in flux.  We are currently learning a term at a time how they will be used.  For Fall term, P/NP grades will count as letter grades for satisfying major and degree requirements.  

Most faculty expect there to be an asterisk on pandemic period grades, but we can't guarantee how they will be perceived outside PSU.

Please consult your funder for potential financial implications of switching to P/NP.  Not all scholarships will fund P/NP courses, and the VA may ask for a return of tuition, fees and associated BAH payments if the student does not pass the course.


# Modules


1. Math:  You need Freshman High School Algebra for this class. This is one of the biggest stumbling blocks.

1. What is Economics (Ch 1):  It is bigger than you thought and even helps explain small behaviors.

1. The Basis for Trade and PPFs (Ch 2):  There are very good reasons make somethings yourself and to buy others.  

1. Supply and Demand (Ch 3):  What everyone knows.  This is a good simple model for many things, but not everything.

1. Consumer and Producer Surplus  (Ch 4): This is one of the ways economists measure welfare, how well off people are not free money.

1. Price and Quantity Controls (Ch 5):  Sometimes you can make people better off by constraining price and sometimes you make people worse off,

1. Elasticity (Ch 6):  A measure of how flexible people, businesses and other institutions are to changes, including price and income changes.

1. Taxes (Ch 7):  Taxes are a source of revenue for public services, but they can also be used to cure problems in markets.  Who pays for taxes  is less clear than you thought.

1. Behind Supply Curves (Ch 11): Not all markets, choices, or allocation mechanisms can be described by supply and demand.  Cost curves allow us to find out what happens in those circumstances.

1. Perfect Competition (Ch 12) :  We prove to ourselves that we can use cost curves to describe what happens in perfect competition, when markets are the right tool for the job.

1. Monopoly (Ch 13): Uses cost curves to describe the costs to society of market power.

1. Monopolistic Competition (Ch 15):  The most common market structure you interact with.  If it has a prominent brand -- its monopolistic competition.

1. Externalities (Ch 16) :  This is where economist spend much of their time. We will use tools to figure out how to do things like reduce air pollution and traffic to were the benefits to society are as large as possible.  

1. Public Goods (Ch 17):  There are some goods we share -- like parks, roads, national defense. Deciding how much of these shared goods around is more complex that figuring out how many cups of coffee to drink.

+ Accommodations are collaborative efforts between students, faculty, and the Disability Resource Center.  If you have a documented disability and require accommodation, you must arrange to meet with the course instructor prior to or within the first week of the term.  The documentation of your disability must come in writing from the Disability Resource Center (Faculty letter).  

+ PSU values diversity and inclusion; we are committed to fostering mutual respect and full participation for all students. My goal is to create a learning environment that is equitable, useable, inclusive, and welcoming. If any aspects of instruction or course design result in barriers to your inclusion or learning, please notify me. The Disability  Resource Center (DRC) provides reasonable accommodations for students who encounter barriers in the learning environment. 

    If you have, or think you may have, a disability that may affect your work in this class and feel you need accommodations, contact the Disability Resource Center to schedule an appointment and initiate a conversation about reasonable accommodations. The DRC is located in 116 Smith Memorial Student Union, 503-725-4150, drc@pdx.edu, https://www.pdx.edu/drc.

+ Academic honesty is expected and required of students enrolled in this course.  Suspected academic dishonesty in this course will be handled according to the procedures set out in the Student Code of Conduct.

+ I am sympathetic to family emergencies but you must inform me as soon as possible. If the notice is verbal, please email me with your understanding of our agreement. All agreements have to be in writing.

+ There is no extra credit.
