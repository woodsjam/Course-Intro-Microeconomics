# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

 > A study of the choices individuals face as participants in the markets for goods, services and factors of production like labor; behavior of profit-maximizing firms operating in markets with varying degrees of competitive pressure; potential role of government in intervening to influence market outcomes using taxes and subsidies; reasons for international trade and economic inequality.

It is my intent to give you a basket of tools that you can use to better understand the news, your later economics courses, and how small differences in institutions can dramatically change the choices we make.


## Technology Requirements

It is assumed that you can access the class via zoom and have a functioning web browser that can access google docs when you are logged in on your @pdx.edu account.  The slides are interactive and assume you have some kind of touch or pseudo-pen interface. You could use your finger and your phone (which works but I would not recommend), a computer with a touch screen, or even a small \$30 Wacom tablet.

The technology requirements are your responsibility. 

# Contact Information

Communication will be handled through slack <http://woodseconomics.slack.com/>. You should have received an invitation, if not, just go to that URL and use this link (**JOIN LINK HERW**) and your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started (<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users>)

Slack will be used for IM, email and forum style communication. It even handles phone and video calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels, e.g., \#macro_general. If you have a personal message that is not intended for others, send a direct message, i.e., @woodsj.

Office Hours:

-   Zoom office hours are Monday 3:30-5:30pm and Tuesday 10:00-11:30. There are no office hours final exam week.  
-   You can schedule one-on-one meetings at <https://woodsj.youcanbook.me/>. These will be online meetings through zoom.

# Basis for Grade


## Basis for Grade

Your grade in the class will be determined by the number of modules you complete at an acceptable level. The more modules you complete, the higher your grade.

Quizzes for each module will be available for three weeks. There will generally be an adaptive quiz, which you can take at any time once it is available. You need a minimum score on the adaptive quiz before the fixed quiz opens. **The adaptive quizzes can take anywhere from 15 minutes to forever.**  

You can take the fixed quiz once per week in each of the three weeks it is open. This does not mean that you get three tries. If your first attempt is on the last available week -- you get one attempt. **The fixed quizzes should take between 30 minutes to an hour to complete but you will be given 1:30.**

Acceptable adaptive and fixed quiz scores may be determined either before or after students take the quizzes.

-   B-: 12 Modules
-   C+: 9 Modules
-   C: 7 Modules
-   P: 7 Modules
-   D: 5 Modules



# The In-class Experience

I am anticipating that some of the class will be joining our meeting in-person and some remotely. This class is built to be fully remote if things get odd.

## Regular Lecture Days

I'll have zoom up on my laptop, but I'll just have the microphone on. The the in-class material will be a combination of Google slides, which I will share with you and perhaps a jamboard for problem solving. This should work a lot better for those with with slower computer processors and less memory. Zoom video eats cpu cycles.  

The slides will be shared with you and will stay synced with where we are in class. I won't be screen sharing; it will just automatically sync.  This makes it much easier to join by phone without running zoom in the background.

There will also be a lot of collaborative elements to these slides. I may ask you to draw a diagram of a domestic market with imports and I will be able to see what each of you do.  This is why the psudo-pen interface is important. [^2]

[^2]: Pear Deck (<https://www.peardeck.com>) is driving this if you are curious.

Stay alert. Stay engaged.  And I will send feedback via email on what you did in class the next day.

There are no participation points.  You don't get credit for showing up, or logging onto zoom.  Showing up to class is just about the most important thing you can do to be successful. I'm just not gamifying it with points.


# Textbook and Other Resources

I have assigned Krugman, Paul R., and Robin Wells. Microeconomics ed. 6., Worth Publishers. The text is bundled with quizzes and homework assignments and you should be able to purchase the whole package through Canvas.


1. Math:  You need Freshman High School Algebra for this class. This is one of the biggest stumbling blocks.

1. What is Economics (Ch 1):  It is bigger than you thought and even helps explain small behaviors.

1. The Basis for Trade and PPFs (Ch 2):  There are very good reasons make somethings yourself and to buy others.  

1. Supply and Demand (Ch 3):  What everyone knows.  This is a good simple model for many things, but not everything.

1. Consumer and Producer Surplus  (Ch 4): This is one of the ways economists measure welfare, how well off people are not free money.

1. Price and Quantity Controls (Ch 5):  Sometimes you can make people better off by constraining price and sometimes you make people worse off,

1. Elasticity (Ch 6):  A measure of how flexible people, businesses and other institutions are to changes, including price and income changes.

1. Taxes (Ch 7):  Taxes are a source of revenue for public services, but they can also be used to cure problems in markets.  Who pays for taxes  is less clear than you thought.

1. Behind Supply Curves (Ch 11): Not all markets, choices, or allocation mechanisms can be described by supply and demand.  Cost curves allow us to find out what happens in those circumstances.

1. Perfect Competition (Ch 12) :  We prove to ourselves that we can use cost curves to describe what happens in perfect competition, when markets are the right tool for the job.

1. Monopoly (Ch 13): Uses cost curves to describe the costs to society of market power.

1. Monopolistic Competition (Ch 15):  The most common market structure you interact with.  If it has a prominent brand -- its monopolistic competition.

1. Externalities (Ch 16) :  This is where economist spend much of their time. We will use tools to figure out how to do things like reduce air pollution and traffic to were the benefits to society are as large as possible.  

1. Public Goods (Ch 17):  There are some goods we share -- like parks, roads, national defense. Deciding how much of these shared goods around is more complex that figuring out how many cups of coffee to drink.
