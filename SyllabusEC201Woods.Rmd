# Course Description

The official description of the course is:

 > A study of the choices individuals face as participants in the markets for goods, services and factors of production like labor; behavior of profit-maximizing firms operating in markets with varying degrees of competitive pressure; potential role of government in intervening to influence market outcomes using taxes and subsidies; reasons for international trade and economic inequality.

I intend to give you a basket of tools that you can use to better understand the news, your later economics courses, and how small differences in institutions can dramatically change the choices we make.


## Technology Requirements

You should have access to  Zoom and a functioning web browser.  The slides are interactive and assume you have some touch or pseudo-pen interface. For example, you could use your finger and your phone (which works but I would not recommend), a computer with a touch screen, or even a small \$30 Wacom tablet.

The technology requirements are your responsibility. 

# Contact Information

We will handle course communication through slack <http://economicswithwoods.slack.com/>. There is an invite link on the Canvas homepage for this course. Use your @pdx.edu email to sign up. There are reasonable help documents to get you started (<https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-users>)

Slack allows for IM and forum-style communication. It even handles phone and video calls. If you have a question about course material or the course itself, ask in one of the channels, e.g., \#micro_general. If you have a personal message not intended for others, send a direct message to @woodsj.

Office Hours:

Office hours, where I or the GA, Roy, will be active on Slack to answer questions via text, voice, or video, are scattered throughout the week in the attempt to make at least one convenient for you.   I will respond on Slack at other times, but I will not respond immediately.

+ Monday 4-5 pm
+ Tuesday 11am- 1pm
+ Thursday 1-2 pm

# The In-Class Experience

This class is remote, which means it is just like a regular class.  We talk. Ask questions.  Draw things on the whiteboard/jamboard.

## Regular Lecture Days

I'll have Zoom up but will be using it primarily for audio. The in-class material will be a combination of Google slides, which I will share with you, and a jamboard for problem-solving. This combination of tools should work better for those with slower computer processors and less memory. 

The slides will be shared with you and stay synced automatically. There is no need for me to screen share.  This makes it much easier to join by phone without running zoom in the background.

There will also be a lot of collaborative elements to these slides. I may ask you to draw a diagram of a domestic market with imports, and I will see what each of you do.  This is why the psudo-pen interface is important. [^2]

[^2]: Pear Deck (<https://www.peardeck.com>) is driving this if you are curious.

Stay alert. Stay engaged.  Roy and I will send feedback via email on what you did in class.

There is a participation component to this.  We will put your **anonymous** work up for others to see.  We will also look at how well you did on those in-class exercises, either getting things generally right or showing some progress towards doing well. This will show up in the grade book as a quick assessment:

+ 0: Absent or minimally active.
+ 1: Somewhere in the middle.
+ 2: Active student that is making progress towards learning the material.

We will focus on the actual written work, so the extroverts don't get all the credit.

There are no actual `points` for this, but your participation determines the standard that we use in the modules for determining if you pass at an acceptable level.  Active students don't need to show as much in the modules because they have shown it in class.  The others need to score higher on the module exercises.

# Basis for Grade

Your grade in the class will be determined by the number of modules you complete at an acceptable level. The more modules you complete, the higher your grade.

The acceptable level, a weighted average of the exercises in the module, is determined by your participation in-class.  The minimum weighted average to pass the module for each participation level is:

+ Participation 0: 90%
+ Participation 1: 80%
+ Participation 2: 70%

Exercises for all the modules are available now.  You can start if you like.  The due dates are approximately three weeks after introducing the topic in class. 

There will be a `LearningCurve` quiz, which can take anywhere from 15 minutes to forever.  You only get one try at these, so reserve some time.  The grade on these is all or nothing.  Not passing means you need to do much better on the other exercises in the module.

The other exercises, which are a combination of video questions, multiple-choice and graphing, can be attempted at most five times. You have an hour on each attempt.  We take the high score. 

There are at least three exercises in each module. It is easiest to see the Modules in Achieve when you choose to view by `Course Content`.

The cut points for course grades are:

- A : 15 
- A-: 14
- B+: 13
- B : 12
- B-: 11
- C+: 10
- C : 9
- C-: 7
- P : 7

I reserve the right to ease these standards.

# A Few Words

My job is to help you learn.  I set the bounds on what you should be learning, create the drills, give feedback, and help you get what you need out of the course for future classes and life.

Nothing I do will help you learn unless you believe that you can learn and want to learn.  It is impossible to teach an unmotivated learner or someone who thinks they can't learn.

For many of you, the most challenging module is the first one that covers the math you need for the course. You only need Freshman High School Algebra.  The textbook has a summary, but if you need more, work through Khan Academy (https://www.khanacademy.org/math) and get where you have to go.

The second thing I need you to do is read. It is the fastest way to learn.  Lecture[^3] is far more limited in scope and detail, and lecture slides are summaries of summaries.


[^3]: Lecture,  A performative exercise where the teacher pretends to teach, and the student pretends to learn.

A better approach to reading the mass of material you need to read in your courses, and to keep current in your field, is **academic skimming**.  Just Google it and follow the directions.  Your future self will thank you.

My final point is about time.  Expect to spend about twelve hours per week outside of class.  Treat it like daily exercise. Put it on your calendar. Please don't plan on marathon sessions; they don't work.  

# Textbook and Other Resources

I have assigned Krugman, Paul R., and Robin Wells. Microeconomics ed. 6., Worth Publishers. The text is bundled with your online exercises. You should be able to purchase the whole package through https://achieve.macmillanlearning.com/courses/asmeup

## Topics

1. Math:  You need Freshman High School Algebra for this class. This is the stumbling block for half the class.

1. What is Economics (Ch 1):  It is more expansive than you thought.

1. The Basis for Trade and PPFs (Ch 2):  There are excellent reasons to make some things yourself and to buy others.  

1. Supply and Demand (Ch 3):  What everyone knows.  This is an excellent model for many things, but not everything.

1. Consumer and Producer Surplus  (Ch 4): This is one of the ways economists measure welfare, how well off people are, not free money.

1. Price and Quantity Controls (Ch 5):  Sometimes you can make people better off by constraining price, and sometimes you make people worse off.

1. Elasticity (Ch 6):  A measure of how flexible people, businesses, and other institutions are to changes, including price and income changes.

1. Taxes (Ch 7):  Taxes are a source of revenue for public services, but they can also be used to cure problems in markets.  Who pays for taxes is less clear than you thought.

1. Decision Making by Individuals and Firms (Ch 9):  Different ways of thinking about costs and which ones are important, plus a few things about the time-value of money.

1. The Rational Consumer (Ch 10): This is the idealized case and explains vast chunks of human behavior, but not everything economists study.

1. Behind Supply Curves (Ch 11): Supply and demand cannot describe all markets, choices, or allocation mechanisms.  Cost curves allow us to find out what happens in those circumstances.

1. Perfect Competition (Ch 12) :  We prove that we can use cost curves to describe what happens in perfect competition, i.e., when markets are the right tool for the job.

1. Monopoly (Ch 13): Uses cost curves to describe the costs to society of market power.

1. Oligopoly (Ch 14):  Somewhere between Monopoly and Perfect Competition.

1. Monopolistic Competition (Ch 15):  The most common market structure you interact with on a daily basis.  If it has a prominent brand -- it's monopolistic competition.

1. Externalities (Ch 16) :  This is where economists spend much of their time. We will use tools to figure out how to do things like reduce air pollution and traffic.

1. Public Goods (Ch 17): We share some goods -- like parks, roads, and national defense. Deciding how much of these shared goods to have is more complex than figuring out how many cups of coffee to drink.
