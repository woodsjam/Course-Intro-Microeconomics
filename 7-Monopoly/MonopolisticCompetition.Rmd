##  Monopolistic Competition

Old model from the 1930s and before game theory.  Probably the most common market.


If you can remember a brand, it is probably monopolistic competition.

+ smartphones
+ toothpaste
+ The cereal aisle in the grocery store (if you ignore they are made by the same company)


## Assumptions

+ Many buyers and sellers
+ Heterogeneous goods.  There are non-price differences.
+ Firms have price setting behavior.
+ Free entry and exit
+ All firms effect all other firms.  Nothing is local.

The model is used a lot of macroeconomics but only at the EC312 and higher level.

## Good Things About Monopolistic Competition

+ Good at small innovation
+ More personalized, while still mass produced
+ Preserves historical variety

## Small Innovation

Technical Rain jackets

+ Napoleon  pockets
+ Pit zips
+ Low cut in back

## More Personalized

+ Shoes and foot models
+ Cut of pants

## Preserve Historical Variety

+ Tomatoes
+ The Porter
+ Modelo Negra

## The Graphs are the same as Monopoly

## The Bad Things

+ Price and quantity effects
    + Price is higher
    + Less is sold
+ Welfare Effects
    + DWL
    + Reduction in CS

The long-run effects are a little different.


## What is Different? 


+ Entry and exit, yes but how they enter and exit.
+ Entry and exit means that profits are competed down to zero.


Try drawing a monopoly graph with zero economic profit.  


## MC in Long-Run


## Why and How Does That Happen?

Every time a firm leaves or enters, all the other firms' demand functions change.

+ Entry and exit cause decreases and increases in demand.
+ It also changes the elasticity depending on how similar.


## Lets Talk Beer

Imagine I own the only brewery in a small town.  People can either drink the one beer I make, a pilsner, here or they can sit at home and drink water (moist county).

+ If I increase the price of beer -- more people stay home.
+ If I decrease the price of beer -- more people come in

In other words it is a demand curve but pretty inelastic.

## A New Brewery Comes to Town

They make a stout.

Now people have three choices:

+ Drink pilsner here.
+ Drink stout there.
+ Drink water at home.

##  Pretend people have strong beer tastes

+ They either like pilsner or stout
+ Some are willing to switch sides because -- beer.


You lose some customers, decreasing demand.

## Decrease Demand

## What if ...

They make a pilsner too?

We make the same beer.  They are perfect substitutes.

+ If my price is higher -- no customers
+ If my price is lower -- all the customers

We are now perfect competitors and take price as given.  $P=AR=MR=D_{firm}$ Again

## Now Perfect Competitors


## What if ...

They made and IPA?

Similar to, but not the same, and people that like pilsners also like IPAs

Customers become more sensitive to price: 

+ If I raise price, some go home and drink water, others leave to drink IPA.
+ If I lower price, some water drinkers come back, and some IPA drinkers come back.

The more similar the new product, the more your demand curve rotates, becomes more elastic.

## How Entrant Changes Your Demand

## Now Pretend You are the Entrant

What kind of beer do you make?

+ Similar enough to steal customers
+ Not so similar so that you have no market power

## Beerspace

## Each New Entrant

+ Picks a spot where there is profit.
+ Lowers everyone's profit
+ Sooner or later there are no more profitable spots -- everyone has zero economic profit.

This is an evolutionary equilibrium

## In the Long-Run

+ Profits are zero, same as PC.
+ Costs are higher than the minimum of average cost, different than PC.
+ The produce less than quantity at min of AC.  They have excess capacity
